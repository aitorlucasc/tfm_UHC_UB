We are two students finishing the master, previously we studied a BSc in Telecommunications Engineering in Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

## Subject Area of the project
In this era, where a huge amount of information from different fields is gathered and stored, its analysis and the extraction of value have become one of the most attractive tasks for companies and Society in general. The design of solutions for the new questions emerged from data have required multidisciplinary teams. Computer Scientists, Statisticians, Mathematicians,
Biologists, Journalists and Sociologists, as well as many others are now working together in order to provide knowledge from data. This new interdisciplinary field is called Data Science.
The pipeline of any data science goes through asking the right questions; gathering data; cleaning data; generating hypothesis; making inferences; visualizing data; assessing solutions; etc.

## Organization of the project
TO DO.

## Target audiences
This project is addressed to upper-tier undergraduate and beginning graduate students from technical disciplines. Moreover, the thesis is also addressed to professional audiences following continuous education short courses and to researchers from diverse areas following self-study courses.
Basic skills in computer science, mathematics and statistics are required. Python and Pytorch are the basics of this project.
